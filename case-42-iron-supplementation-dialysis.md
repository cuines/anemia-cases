# Case Study: Iron Supplementation in Dialysis Patients

## Patient Presentation
A 58-year-old male with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis for 5 years presents with fatigue and pallor. Laboratory evaluation reveals hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, ferritin 180 ng/mL, TSAT 18%.

## Management Discussion
Intravenous iron supplementation is considered. According to current guidelines, IV iron should be withheld if a patient's ferritin level is greater than 200 ng/mL. This threshold is based on older recommendations; however, recent KDIGO guidelines suggest a higher threshold.

## Treatment Plan
1. Assess iron stores regularly.
2. Consider IV iron if ferritin <500 ng/mL and TSAT <30%.
3. Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions.

## Conclusion
Individualized iron management is crucial in dialysis patients to avoid both deficiency and overload.
